# 🧪 PhysXine – C++ Physics Engine on OpenGL 4.6

**PhysXLoop** is a physics-first simulation engine built from scratch in modern C++ using **OpenGL 4.6** for rendering and **Eigen** for mathematical precision. It’s designed for accurate, real-time physical interaction — with core focus on robust **collision detection/resolution**, a **modular entity model**, and an **event-controlled runtime** that enables seamless switching between simulation and camera control.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Unlike traditional render-first engines, PhysXLoop prioritizes **physics determinism and logical accuracy** over GPU performance. While it integrates rendering using OpenGL, its strength lies in a cleanly separated **physics loop** that runs in sync (or optionally detached) from the rendering loop using a lambda-controlled runner.

## 🧪 Example Simulation

> **Sphere–Sphere Collision Demo**
> Two spheres collide elastically with position correction and velocity exchange. Penetration is resolved using impulse-based solver.

> **AABB Stack Stress Test**
> Multiple stacked AABBs fall and resolve collisions, showcasing broad-phase + narrow-phase handling.
